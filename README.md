# Auth Page
A small static sign-in / sign-up UI demo â€” a front-end page that shows the authentication screens (forms for entering email/username and password, and a sign-up form).
Intended for demonstrating the UI and client-side behavior (form layout, styling, basic validation) rather than a full backend-auth system.
